### Steps
* I am tasked with setting up a virtual machine (EC2 instance) on AWS for a small web application. 
Instead of doing this manually via the AWS console, I have used Terraform to automate the process.

* I am creating the ec2 instance in my main.tf file and have used env variables for the setting the access key and secret key to connect my aws account.
